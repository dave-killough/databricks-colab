One option for doing this is creating a Databricks secret that guards the sensitive information while enabling its safe use in code and redaction in logs. Although configuring a Databricks secret is not supported in the Workspace UI, it can be easily accomplished through the Databricks CLI. This entire process can be executed within a notebook.\n",

In the following cell, replace the <WORKSPACE_HOST> part with the beginning of the URL used to access your Workspace. Your host value should look similar to this:\n",
